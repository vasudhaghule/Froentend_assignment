The project uses the Binance WebSocket API to retrieve real-time market data for the selected cryptocurrency.
The project uses Chart.js to display the market data in a candlestick chart.
The project allows users to select between different cryptocurrencies (ETH/USDT, BNB/USDT, DOT/USDT) and time intervals (1 minute, 3 minutes, 5 minutes).
The project uses local storage to persist the chart data for each cryptocurrency, so that the chart can be restored when the user switches back to a previously selected cryptocurrency.
The project is designed to be modular and flexible, so that it can be easily extended or modified to support additional features or cryptocurrencies.
